# 8BitDo Firmware Updater

A Python tool to automatically download and flash firmware updates for 8BitDo gamepads on Linux, without requiring the official Upgrade Tool.

- üì• **Automatic firmware download** - Fetches the latest firmware directly from 8BitDo's servers
- üîÑ **Version selection** - Choose from multiple firmware versions, including beta releases
- üîç **Automatic device detection** - Finds your connected gamepad automatically
- ‚ö° **One-command flashing** - Handles the entire update process
- üßπ **Cleanup** - Optional removal of downloaded firmware files
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly** - Clear instructions and confirmations at every step

## Supported Gamepads

## Troubleshooting

### Gamepad Not Detected

- Make sure the gamepad is in **bootloader mode** (LED blinking red)
- Verify the USB cable is properly connected
- Try a different USB port or cable
- Check if fwupd detects the device: `fwupdmgr get-devices`

### Permission Errors

The script uses `sudo` for flashing firmware. If you encounter permission issues:
```bash
# Make sure your user is in the plugdev group
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

### Firmware Flash Timeout

If the firmware flash times out:
1. Manually restart your gamepad by disconnecting and reconnecting it
2. Verify the update completed: `fwupdmgr get-devices`

### fwupd Not Found

Install fwupd for your distribution (see Requirements section above).
## Manual Update Process

If you prefer to update manually or troubleshoot issues, see the orgininal guide in https://ladis.cloud/blog/posts/firmware-update-8bitdo.html for detailed instructions.
## How It Works

This tool automates the process described in the original blog post:

    Queries 8BitDo's API to get available firmware versions
    Downloads the firmware file from 8BitDo's servers
    Uses fwupd to detect the connected gamepad in bootloader mode
    Flashes the firmware using fwupdtool
